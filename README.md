metricq-wizard-backend
================

Your new web app is ready to go!

To run your app in development mode you'll need to:

1. Activate a python >=3.8 environment
2. Install the required packages with `pip install -e .[dev]`
3. Make sure the app's settings are configured correctly (see `app/settings.py`). You can also
 use environment variables to define sensitive settings, eg. DB connection variables
4. You can then run your app during development with `adev runserver -s static -v --debug-toolbar metricq_wizard_backend`
